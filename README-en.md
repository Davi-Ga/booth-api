Booth is a Photo Albums API developed with Django REST Framework, which allows users to create and share their photo albums online. With Booth, users can upload their images into custom albums and share them with friends and family. The API provides advanced album and image management features to offer a complete and secure experience.

## Key Features

- **Create Albums:** Users can create custom albums and assign a title and description to each album.

- **Add Photos:** Users can upload their photos to the albums they created. The API supports various image formats with automatic file type detection.

- **Share with Others:** Albums can be shared with other registered users through invitations. Guests can view and comment on the photos but cannot edit the album or add/remove photos.

- **Comments:** Users can add comments to the photos in the albums they have permission to view.
